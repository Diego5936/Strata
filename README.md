# Strata

Strata is a micro-society of agents trained across different landscapes to visualize how different environmental conditions, with equal reward systems, can produce diverse patterns of thinking and evolution.

I am implementing the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm from scratch in C#, which allows me to experiment with deep neural networks while simulating evolutionary processes. This project lets me work like a scientist, analyzing data and presenting it in ways that enable me to draw hypotheses and conclusions about how simulations evolve over time.

Strata is still not a finished project, but it may never be. Watching generations of agents interact and learn allows me to analyze patterns in the algorithms I’ve implemented, which tend to lead to more “what if” questions that lead me to tweak parameters and further develop my understanding.
